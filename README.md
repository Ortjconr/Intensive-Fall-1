Political Playing Card.
The project I have worked on is a informational tool when it comes to politics. It is a way for voters who are unsure about a party's platform an opportunity to understand who supports what. This site that I designed is also to help unsure voters understand what candidates support what. This in turn will give voters an opportunity to understand ,without the false information, how they feel aligns with thier views.
